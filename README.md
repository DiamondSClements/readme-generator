# README-generator

## Description
An app using node.js that automically creates README from user's info.

## Installation
*I started by copying the starter code that was provided from the UTA bootcamp class repository. 
*From there I installed the inquirer package needed for this assignment and created my repository.
*I created my prompt questions and my call back questions that would store the users input, render licenses, and also generate the README file. 
*This assignment used the language node.js and I was able to gain a better understanding after completing this application. 

## Usage 
The purpose of this application was to allow a user to create a professional README by inputting data from the prompt questions, and having that data sourced to an automatic README generator.
